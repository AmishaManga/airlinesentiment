# Bayesian Modeling of Twitter Airline Retweet Probability

## Description: 
This project explores the Kaggle Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset using Bayesian modeling with PyMC.
Rather than predicting sentiment (as in the original Kaggle competition), the objective I have defined here is:

**Estimate the probability that a tweet is retweeted at least once.**

## Dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment

## Exploratory Data Analysis: 
Please see notebook titled "EDA"

## Prerequisites:
Ensure Tweets.csv in the root directory and that pymc has been installed.

## Installation Steps:
Install pymc on machine:  
https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/installation.html

For windows:\
$ conda create -c conda-forge -n pymc_env "pymc>=5"  

$ conda activate pymc_env
